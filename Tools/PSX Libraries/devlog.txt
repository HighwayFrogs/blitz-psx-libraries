Andy Sidwell's Development Log for PSX Libraries
================================================

1-12-99
=======

Tidied up the docs and header file for the sound library, it was in a complete state from before it was changed to entirely queue based. It's all up to date now, so it should be okay.

textureInitialise() now takes parameters for the number of 16-color and 256-colour palettes you want. Hence, we also have a textureDestroy() function now to clean up.


30-11-99
========

Added a call to utilUpperStr() in fileLoad(), so that filenames automatically get promoted to upper-case. This should save all of the grief people have been having with their darn lower-case filenames. :)

Found and fixed the bug in the sound library. I was comparing an unsigned value (sfxFrameNum) with a signed value(lastSampleCall[n]), hence it would never play any sound.


29-11-99
========

Fixed a "doh!" bug in the memory library, where (sizeof(AllocBlock) * maxAllocs) wasn't being subtracted from the size of the pool. This meant that discs would run on kits, but not on debug stations, because it was writing over the 2mb limit. Duh!


24-11-99
========

Added a couple of small things to the texture library: the debugging palette counter is now reset when textureInitialise() is called.

textureInitialise() now takes a parameter, specifying the number of 256-colour cluts to allocate at the start of VRAM.

Added a couple of helper macros from Rich for finding textures by name.


22-11-99
========

Fixed the inheritScale option in the PSI library, it wasn't working previously, but it should be now.

psiRegisterDrawFunction() and psiRegisterDrawFunction2() now return a pointer to the previously registered draw function, making it easier for people to manage a set of custom draw handlers.


19-11-99
========

Been working on PS2 stuff for a while, got textures loading pretty much okay now, just a few problems with 64x16's (???) , still haven't figured it out yet.

Added an extra bit to the memory library, so that it now prints out the address of damaged memory blocks, as well as where they were allocated.


11-11-99
========

Added the "inheritScale" member to PSImodelctrl. Should allow people to choose whether they want their models to inherit scale down the hierarchy.

Renamed the function VRAMfindTextureN() to textureFindTextureN() and exported it, so that Mikey's fx editor can select textures by number, rather than by name.


10-11-99
========

Finally got the darn thing working, those sneaky guys had hidden the flashrom in the root directory, meaning it was in /usr/local, not under /usr/local/sce. Grrrr!

Demos rather uninspiring, but the particle one is quite pretty.

EA came around to grill us on our suitability for Chicken Run (PS2).


9-11-99
=======

Got the libraries and compiler for the PS2. Only 100meg download, great. Still doesn't work though.


8-11-99
=======

PS2 dev-kit arrived today... Without any software... Great...


5-11-99
=======

Action Man is released today! Hurrah!

Added an analog emulation mode to the pad library, so that digital pads produce an "analog" output, meaning you only need to read one set of inputs for both analog and digital pads.


4-11-99
=======

Made another couple of small changes to the PSI library:- when drawing dynamically sorted models, psiCalcMaxMin() now only clears the sort table the amount it needs, rather than the whole thing. This resulted in a saving of 150 scan-lines on my test bed (4 models, AM, Teenbot, Ariel & Triton), from 599 to 449!

Added a new function, psiAllocWorkspace(), which allocates the buffers needed for drawing (transformed verts and normals), after you've loaded all your models, rather than re-allocating it every time you load a larger model. This should obviously help memory fragmentation somewhat.

Another couple of minor optimisations:- the normal transformation now has the pointer increment in parallel with the GTE transform. Saved about 8 scanlines on my testbed with dynamically sorted models, but only 1 scanline with non-dynamically sorted models. Bizarre...

Added an "if" in the rotation setup, so that the matrix calculation and multiplication of a user specified rotation is performed only if there is one. This saved about 14 scanlines on my testbed. The 4 non-dynamically sorted models is now down to 384 (compared to 399 yesterday), dynamic is now 428 (compared to 599 yesterday).


3-11-99
=======

Found the horrible slowdown problem, turns out that large models were being loaded and the internal sort-list was getting huge (over 5000 entries). This was having to be cleared every time a model was being drawn, hence the loooonnnggg time in psiCalcMaxMix(). This has now been sorted by Ian, who's customised his actor.c to sort this out.


2-11-99
=======

Finished the reference counting of textures, freeing a texture now checks its reference count and only frees it from VRAM when there are no other references to it. CRC's now work properly (rather that not). Also checks to see if the texture dimensions are the same, just in case two different sized textures produce the same CRC (unlikely, but nevertheless possible).

Edited all the libraries makefiles to enable optimisation on debug builds, as un-optimised builds were getting too slow to be usable.


1-11-99
=======

Working on the texture library at the moment. Added some limited 256 colour support (only 16 palettes). Changed the palette organisation, so that ram copies are not needed any more, just uses CRC's instead. Textures also now have CRC's, so that textures with multiple palettes can be used without wasting VRAM.


30-10-99
========

Playing FFVIII and being amazed by their effects. Came in and did some mad full screen stuff, bit slow but it's a start. Must put FFVIII through the analyser and see exactly what they're doing.


29-10-99
========

Spent the last two days at Chessington World of Adventures, doing some P.R. stuff for Hasbro at the Action Man shop there.

Sony has contacted us and have said they will give us a PS2 kit very soon! Way hey!


26-10-99
========

Added actorDraw2() at the request of Recoil, for setting up and drawing non-animated, non-hierarchical meshes. Doesn't seem to make that much difference, but if it keeps them happy...

Did some more tidying up on the psi header files, all psi functions now have description comments.

Found a bug in the sound library which meant it wouldn't even compile, fixed it (conflicting definitions for sfxPlaySound(), that darn Tom I bet!)


25-10-99
========

Added psiRegisterDrawFunction2(), which lets you use your own draw function for non-dynamically sorted models.

Finished documenting the exported functions for islpsi.lib.

Paul Holman & Alister Bodin from SCEE are visiting this afternoon. Erk!

Re-wrote actorIsVisible() to try and make it a bit more efficient/reliable.

Fixed a few bugs in the draw functions that meant flat shaded models would crash and burn.

The Sony visit didn't go quite as well as we hoped. They only have 20 PS2 kits for Europe this year, so it's looking unlikely that we'll get one before next year.

On the other hand, managed (at last!) to get my hands on a PS2 dev CD with all the docs on. Looks like a tasty piece of hardware, not as tricky as I thought it would be. Just a case of turning your brain on it's side.


22-10-99
========

Spend most of the day trying to fix minor but important problems with the skinning library.

Rewrote psiCalcLocalMatrix to use psiCalcChildMatrix. It's now exactly the same as psiCalcWorldMatrix, except it doesn't take into account the camera matrix. Wrote a quick little function, actorDrawBones, that draws the bones of a model, using the actual world co-ords of the bones in order to demonstrate using psiCalcLocalMatrix. I'm wondering if the function names are actually correct, such that psiCalcWorldMatrix should be psiCalcScreenMatrix, and psiCalcLocalMatrix should be psiCalcWorldMatrix. I'm not too sure about changing them though, because I know it'll just cause even more confusion with people already using the (non-library) psi stuff.

Spend quite a while trying to track down a phantom sorting problem when using the sort tables with the PSX's order tables. Turned out it was just overflowing the order table, so stuff that should have been printed at the back was wrapping around and being printed at the front instead. Scaling the model down and moving the camera in solved this (Duh).

Changed the psiLoad function so that it now takes the full path of a model, rather than just the name. Again, Tom G. was having problems with loading models in subdirectories. This should be standard, as files should be organised properly, rather than having everything in one directory.

The setup overhead for a minor non-animated model seems to be quite big, I must look at seeing if this can brought down. Doesn't seem to be the animation setup, so I'll set up some timers and see what arises.


21-10-99
========

Addressed some issues found with the skinning library after Tom G. had some problems.

The normals were being scaled with the model, so the lighting intensity would increase/decrease with the size of the model.

The normals were also being rotated by the camera matrix, so if the camera moved, the lights would also move.

Both these problems have been fixed by using the matrixscale member of PSIOBJECT to draw the model, while the matrix member is merely a rotated/translated version, without scale or camera rotation.

Made psiSetRotate/Scale/MoveKeyFrames(2)() static, and provided a psiSetKeyFrames(2)() function which calls them instead. Makes the interface a whole lot neater.

The reference drawing function now sorts the model into the global sort table as well as against itself. This should help sorting with other objects.

Found out from Sony that we should hopefully be getting a PS2 dev-kit around the end of November. That should be fun!

Continued to document islpsi.lib, darn this is hard work.


20-10-99
========

Worked on the skinning library today. Split off all the actor functions into a separate file, which will be provided as source code for people to use however they want. The actual animation setup/blending and rendering functions will be provided as a library.

Provided a function which will allow people to use their own backend to draw models. A reference driver will be provided so that people can write their own one.


19-10-99
========

Had a meeting this morning with Andrew, Richard, Fred, Chris S., Ian, Scott and Byron, on the future of the library system. Agreed on a whole load of additions to be made once the initial release is out, which should be within the next two weeks.

Started working on a users guide for the libraries. Not too sure exactly how basic to start, so I've beginning at the installation stage, with how to set up your compiler to include and link in the new libs.
