Andy Sidwell's Development Log for PSX Libraries

Addressed some issues found with the skinning library after Tom G. had some problems.

The normals were being scaled with the model, so the lighting intensity would increase/decrease with the size of the model.

The normals were also being rotated by the camera matrix, so if the camera moved, the lights would also move.

Both these problems have been fixed by using the matrixscale member of PSIOBJECT to draw the model, while the matrix member is merely a rotated/translated version, without scale or camera rotation.

Made psiSetRotate/Scale/MoveKeyFrames(2)() static, and provided a psiSetKeyFrames(2)() function which calls them instead. Makes the interface a whole lot neater.

The reference drawing function now sorts the model into the global sort table as well as against itself. This should help sorting with other objects.

Found out from Sony that we should hopefully be getting a PS2 dev-kit around the end of November. That should be fun!

Continued to document islpsi.lib, darn this is hard work.

Worked on the skinning library today. Split off all the actor functions into a separate file, which will be provided as source code for people to use however they want. The actual animation setup/blending and rendering functions will be provided as a library.

Provided a function which will allow people to use their own backend to draw models. A reference driver will be provided so that people can write their own one.

Had a meeting this morning with Andrew, Richard, Fred, Chris S., Ian, Scott and Byron, on the future of the library system. Agreed on a whole load of additions to be made once the initial release is out, which should be within the next two weeks.

Started working on a users guide for the libraries. Not too sure exactly how basic to start, so I've beginning at the installation stage, with how to set up your compiler to include and link in the new libs.
